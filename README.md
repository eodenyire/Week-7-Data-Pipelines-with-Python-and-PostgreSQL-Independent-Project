# Week-7-Data-Pipelines-with-Python-and-PostgreSQL-Independent-Project

Project Description:

Telecommunications Equipment Failure Prevention with Data Pipeline

This project aims to minimize downtime and improve overall equipment performance by proactively identifying potential equipment failures through the collection and analysis of large amounts of data generated by various equipment and network sensors. The solution is a data pipeline built using Python and PostgreSQL, with the Postgres database hosted on Google Cloud.

The data pipeline is designed to efficiently collect, clean, and analyze equipment and network sensor data. The pipeline starts with data extraction from various sources, including network sensors, equipment sensors, and maintenance records. Sample datasets for data extraction will be provided by the client and should be used for building the pipeline.

The collected data is then transformed by cleaning and ensuring consistency and quality. This involves removing duplicates, fixing missing data, and normalizing the data for consistency. The data can also be aggregated, joined, or enriched to gain additional insights.

The resulting cleaned data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for future use. The cleaned data will be used to build machine learning models that can predict potential equipment failures and schedule maintenance proactively. The models will be designed to analyze equipment and network sensor data in real-time to identify anomalies and predict potential failures.

The solution is a comprehensive approach to prevent equipment failures and optimize equipment performance in the telecommunications industry.
